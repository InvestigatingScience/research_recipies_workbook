# OpenAlex 

OpenAlex is a free and open catalog research. It is structured around “works”, a term which stands for any sort of scholarly output, such as research articles, datasets, books, and dissertations. OpenAlex collects these works and metadata about them and creates connections through journals, authors, institutional affiliations, citations, concepts and funders. OpenAlex is run by the nonprofit OurResearch and is open-source and free to use under the CC0 license.

OpenAlex is now the standard for an open bibliographic database and is as such central to projects like ours. 

Its data is available via an API and a full database snapshot, as well an web application for searching and exploring.
