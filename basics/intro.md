# Investigating Science - Research Recipies

This is a workbook to get journalists started to use open source information with only little programming skills. 

It gives an overview on the Investigating Science project, important databases such Open Alex, as well as hands-on research recipies.

Investigating Science wants to help journalists to be watchdogs of science and research. It uses bibliometrics, i.e. the analysis of scientific publication databases, to identify indications of problematic research practices such as citation cartels, predatory journals, retracted articles and other abuses in the research and publication system. The research platform offers sample analyses, recipes and code for carrying out these analyses yourself. 

Problems with research integrity are widespread and damage the scientific system. For example, high-ranking and groundbreaking publications on Alzheimer's disease have come under suspicion of falsification. A 2016 analysis found problems in 3.8 percent of the studies analyzed, half of which pointed to intentional manipulation, with a presumably much higher number of unreported cases. A study this year estimated the number of potentially falsified papers in medicine at over 20 percent. 

The control and correction mechanisms of the scientific system are sometimes inadequate. Even proven flawed studies are not reliably retracted and if this happens, they sometimes continue to be cited and thus remain part of the body of knowledge. Researchers implicated in wrongdoing very rarely experience consequences. 

Investigative science journalism can take on the role of a watchdog, but faces technological hurdles to systematically tackle the topic. This is where we want to help with our methods and knowledge.
